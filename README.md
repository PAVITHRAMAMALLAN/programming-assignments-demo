# Programming Assignments at Coursera

This repository is meant for instructors that are planning to add programming assignments to their courses on Coursera. It contains code to create simple docker graders that can be used to grade programming assignments on Coursera's new on-demand platform. These graders can be seen live in action in our [demo] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/pa-on-demand/outline) course. Please reach out to programming@coursera.org in case you don't have access.

Visit our partner help center's programming assignments [page] (https://partner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/205314475) for more information.
